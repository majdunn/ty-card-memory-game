/* MJ Review Notes
- The code is generally clear and straightforward. There are no confusing elements, properties, or hacks.
- The naming and organization are consistent throughout the code. Each section is clearly defined with meaningful variable names.
- The code seems to be focused on styling and layout, which is less likely to have cross-browser issues. However, it's always a good practice to test in multiple browsers to ensure compatibility.
- The code is already quite readable. However, you might consider grouping related properties together, such as grouping gradient variables, text-related variables, etc., for even clearer organization.
- The code is relatively concise, and there are no duplicate lines. It seems well-optimized.
- Overall, the CSS is well-structured, readable, and seems to follow best practices. Minor adjustments for even clearer organization could be made, but it's already in good shape.
